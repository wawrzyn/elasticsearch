=== Ingest Attachment Processor Plugin

The ingest attachment plugin lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF) by
using the Apache text extraction library http://lucene.apache.org/tika/[Tika].

You can use the ingest attachment plugin as a replacement for the mapper attachment plugin.

The source field must be a base64 encoded binary. If you do not want to incur
the overhead of converting back and forth between base64, you can use the CBOR
format instead of JSON and specify the field as a bytes array instead of a string
representation. The processor will skip the base64 decoding then.

[float]
==== Installation

This plugin can be installed using the plugin manager:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------
sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment
----------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin must be installed on every node in the cluster, and each node must
be restarted after installation.

[[ingest-attachment-remove]]
[float]
==== Removal

The plugin can be removed with the following command:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------
sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove ingest-attachment
----------------------------------------------------------------

The node must be stopped before removing the plugin.

NOTE: Extracting contents from binary data is a resource intensive operation and
      consumes a lot of resources. It is highly recommended to run pipelines
      using this processor in a dedicated ingest node.
